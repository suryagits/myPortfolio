# My Portfolio
This repository contains files related to my portfolio. Files other than portfolio related may be added in future as/if required.

## Getting Started
Since this is a simple user interface design for my portfolio, there is nothing complex involved. One just need to install gitbash 
or any such utility to pull this branch to their local or can simply download the zip as well.

### Installation and Setup Prerequisites
There is no software or setup configurations required. One need to have a decent internet connectivity as the code makes use of a CDN to run 
certain external scripts.

### Versioning
There is only one version currently which is in the master branch.

### Authors
Surya

### Acknowledgements

Thank you my batchmates and mentors from Edwisor without whose support and guidance, this repo would not have been possible!
